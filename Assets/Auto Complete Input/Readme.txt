Hey friend :)
Thanks for buying my asset!



The asset is the great auto complete script
You can fully customize it, change everything from options style to animations, tags, max prompt count

My asset works with TMP_InputField and I'm STRONGLY ADVISE you to use TMP text and InputField!!! But obviously you can
easily change it to a default one



How to use it:

There is a scene - here you will see a sample input field where you can start typing and see the prompts
Press on any prompt to set the target text

In a folder Prefabs you can find the AutoComplete object and simply drag it in the canvas
Also here you can find the Prompt object and you can customize it as you wish



Everything about settings and methods you can find in the scrips, every variable and method has a description
The code is fully commented and the AutoCompleteInput is fully customizable
